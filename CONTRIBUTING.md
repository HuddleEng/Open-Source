## How to contribute to HuddleEng OSS projects

#### Submitting changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository
* Submit a pull request to the repository
* Update any related issues with reference to the pull request
* The project maintainer will endeavour to reply within two weeks
* If a pull request is not accepted the project maintainer will explain why
* By running tests in advance and by engaging with peer review for prospective changes, your contributions have a high probability of becoming long lived parts of the project.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the change(s)
* Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable
* Ensure that the tests are passing. Add tests(s) if test coverage does not exist for the change(s)

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

* All changes should be consistent with the code style (implicit or documented) of the project
* All changes must pass static analysis controls as implemented by the Continuous Integration tooling of that project

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* All changes require a pull request which includes a **title and clear description**, new tests for new features. New and existing tests should be passing
* For larger changes, please create an issue first to **collect feedback about the change**

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* You may raise an issue to ask a question, the project may also link from the README to a Q&A or chat application for support.

#### **Did you find a security vulnerability?**

* Do not create an issue or pull request
* Contact opensource@huddle.com providing details of the vulnerability, and any solution or mitigation you may have
* You will be contacted within two weeks
* The vulnerability will be resolved and/or communicated as an issue on the project within a further two weeks
* Fixes will only apply to the latest major version of the project.  Previous versions may be updated at the discretion of the project owner
